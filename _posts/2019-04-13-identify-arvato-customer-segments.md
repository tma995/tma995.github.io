## Introduction

In this project, a mail-order sales company in Germany is interested in identifying segments of the general population to target with their marketing in order to grow. The objective is to describe the core customer base of the company, and to identify which individuals are most likely to respond to the campaign.

### Data files:
* AZDIAS: Demographics data for the general population of Germany; (891,211 x 366).
* CUSTOMERS: Demographics data for customers of a mail-order company; (191,652 x 369).
* MAILOUT_TRAIN: Demographics data for individuals who were targets of a marketing campaign; (42,982 x 367).
* MAILOUT_TEST: Demographics data for individuals who were targets of a marketing campaign; (42,833 x 366).

### Problem Statement
*	Analyze demographics data (provided by Arvato Financial Solutions, a Bertelsmann subsidiary) for customers of a mail-order sales company in Germany, comparing it against demographics information for the general population. 
*	Use unsupervised learning techniques to perform customer segmentation, identifying the parts of the population that best describe the core customer base of the company.
*	Use supervised learning techniques to predict customer responses in a marketing campaign for the mail-order company, which is also a Kaggle competition.
